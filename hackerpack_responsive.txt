Responsive issues:

You can see that when the site is on mobile/small browser, the content is 
messed up like this:

This is because the site isn't mobile responsive. To fix that, you can do the 
followings:

1. For the "Meet the Team" section:

- use Bootstrap grid system: https://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/
(the website already utilizes Bootstrap so you can start using the
element without inserting any additional scripts)
- On a big screen, you will be able to see both
biographies side-by-side. When the broswer gets smaller, the site
should be responsive by placing the second biography under the 
first biography. 
- The image and font should also be responsive by getting smaller 
when the broswer gets smaller. 
	- For image, you can use the class .img-responsive. However,
	you should be able to control the size of the image when using
	the class through customized CSS.
	- For font, I'd suggest using vmin instead of em or px.

2. For the "Sign Up" section:

- Instead of using the class .button, you can use Bootstrap's button .btn
class, which is responsive by itself.
- You should also edit the font so that it is resposive with the button (eg.
wrap around when getting smaller, etc.)

3. Bonus: When you make the broswer smaller, you will notice that the logo
is no longer in the middle of the page, and it is also too big. You can
make the logo responsive through using CSS properties position, max-width,
max-height.
